### PostExploitation.com is a collection TTPs (tools, tactics, and procedures) for what to do after access has been gained.

### Live Online Copy:

You can find a copy of the project online at: http://mubix.github.io/post-exploitation-wiki/

### Offline Use:

  1. Clone the repository or pull the archive ([download zip](https://github.com/mubix/post-exploitation-wiki/archive/master.zip)) of the repo
  2. Open index.html
  3. Most modern browsers don't allow the access of local files from a locally loaded HTML file. On Windows you can use [Mongoose Tiny](http://cesanta.com/downloads.html) or [HFS](http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/) to host the files locally. On OSX and Linux `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` seems to work just fine.

#### Referenced tools can be found here: https://github.com/mubix/post-exploitation (If they aren't built into the OS)
